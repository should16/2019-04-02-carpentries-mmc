## Requirements

Some specific software (in addition to R, devtools, and some more common
R packages) will help to recreate the results for this paper from
scratch. The easiest thing would be to clone this package or to install
via `devtools`. If you don’t want to do that, you can instead install
the following:

**To download raw data:** \*
[rnassqs](https://github.com/potterzot/rnassqs) \*
[censusapi](https://github.com/hrecht/censusapi)

**To run the analysis:**

## How to use this repository

There are a few different ways you may want to use this repository:

1.  To reproduce or examine work and results from the paper.
2.  As a base to expand on the research contained herein. If so you may
    want to just fork the repository and continue on. Contributions to
    this repository are also welcome\! Please follow the contribution
    guidelines and submit a pull request when ready.
3.  As a framework for a [reproducible research]() project. In that case
    a better alternative might be my
    [research-template](github.com/%3Cusername%3E/research-template),
    which provides a skeleton with some thoughts about the best use.
    There are several other (and probably better) attempts at this,
    including [rrrpkg](https://github.com/ropensci/rrrpkg),
    [projecttemplate](http://projecttemplate.net/), and [cboettig’s
    template](https://github.com/cboettig/template).
4.  Use it to access the data used in the project. I haven’t worked this
    out yet, but to the extent possible all data will be made available.
